     AssertionError: Timed out retrying after 4000ms: expected '<span.font-bold.text-sm.truncate.max-w-[80px].pointer-events-none.select-none>' to be 'visible'

This element `<span.font-bold.text-sm.truncate.max-w-[80px].pointer-events-none.select-none>` is not visible because its content is being clipped by one of its parent elements, which has a CSS property of overflow: `hidden`, `clip`, `scroll` or `auto`
